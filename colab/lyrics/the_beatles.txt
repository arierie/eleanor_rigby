Yesterday
All my troubles seemed so far away
Now it looks as though they're here to stay
Oh, I believe in yesterday
Suddenly
I'm not half the man I used to be
There's a shadow hanging over me
Oh, yesterday came suddenly
Why she had to go
I don't know, she wouldn't say
I said something wrong
Now I long for yesterday
Yesterday
Love was such an easy game to play
Now I need a place to hide away

There are places I'll remember
All my life, though some have changed
Some forever, not for better
Some have gone and some remain
All these places had their moments
With lovers and friends, I still can recall
Some are dead and some are living
In my life, I've loved them all
But of all these friends and lovers
There is no one compares with you
And these memories lose their meaning
When I think of love as something new
Though I know I'll never lose affection
For people and things that went before
I know I'll often stop and think about them
In my life, I love you more

I read the news today, oh boy
About a lucky man who made the grade
And though the news was rather sad
Well, I just had to laugh
I saw the photograph
He blew his mind out in a car
He didn't notice that the lights had changed
A crowd of people stood and stared
They'd seen his face before
Nobody was really sure if he was from the House of Lords
I saw a film today, oh boy
The English Army had just won the war
A crowd of people turned away
But I just had to look
Having read the book
I'd love to turn you on
(Seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve…)
Alarm clock rings
Woke up, fell out of bed
Dragged a comb across my head
Found my way downstairs and drank a cup
And looking up I noticed I was late
Found my coat and grabbed my hat
Made the bus in seconds flat
Found my way upstairs and had a smoke
And somebody spoke and I went into a dream
Ahh-ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ahh
I read the news today, oh boy
Four thousand holes in Blackburn, Lancashire
And though the holes were rather small
They had to count them all
Now they know how many holes it takes to fill the Albert Hall

I once had a girl
Or should I say, she once had me?
She showed me her room
"Isn't it good, Norwegian wood?"
She asked me to stay and she told me to sit anywhere
So I looked around and I noticed there wasn't a chair
I sat on the rug
Biding my time, drinking her wine
We talked until two
And then she said, "It's time for bed"
She told me she worked in the morning and started to laugh
I told her I didn't and crawled off to sleep in the bath
And when I awoke
I was alone, this bird had flown
So I lit a fire

Now somewhere in the black mining hills of Dakota
There lived a young boy named Rocky Raccoon
And one day his woman ran off with another guy
Hit young Rocky in the eye
Rocky didn't like that
He said, "I'm gonna get that boy"
So one day he walked into town
Booked himself a room in the local saloon
And Rocky Raccoon checked into his room
Only to find Gideon's Bible
Rocky had come equipped with a gun
To shoot off the legs of his rival
His rival, it seems, had broken his dreams
By stealing the girl of his fancy
Her name was Magill, and she called herself Lil
But everyone knew her as Nancy
Now, she and her man, who called himself Dan
Were in the next room at the hoe-down
Rocky burst in, and grinning a grin
He said, "Danny boy, this is a showdown"
But Daniel was hot, he drew first and shot
And Rocky collapsed in the corner, aaah

Now, the doctor came in, stinking of gin
And proceeded to lie on the table
He said, "Rocky, you met your match"
And Rocky said, "Doc, it's only a scratch
And I'll be better, I'll be better, Doc, as soon as I am able"
Now, Rocky Raccoon, he fell back in his room
Only to find Gideon's Bible (Oh, dou-dou-dou)
Gideon checked out, and he left it, no doubt (Oooh Rocky, oooh)
To help with good Rocky's revival, aah
Yeah, yeah

Wishing to avoid an unpleasant sce-e-e-ene

In Penny Lane there is a barber showing photographs
Of every head he's had the pleasure to know
And all the people that come and go
Stop and say hello
On the corner is a banker with a motorcar
The little children laugh at him behind his back
And the banker never wears a mac
In the pouring rain
Very strange
Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes
There beneath the blue suburban skies
I sit and meanwhile back
In Penny Lane there is a fireman with an hourglass
And in his pocket is a portrait of the Queen
He likes to keep his fire engine clean
It's a clean machine

And then the fireman rushes in

Very strange
Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes
There beneath the blue suburban skies
I sit, and meanwhile back
Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes

Then there's this Welsh Rarebit wearing some brown underpants
About the shortage of grain in Hertfordshire
Everyone of them knew that as time went by
They'd get a little bit older and a little bit slower but
It's all the same thing, in this case manufactured by someone who's always
Umpteen time your father's giving it diddly-i-dee
District was leaving, intended to pay for
Number nine, number nine

So the wife called me, and we'd better go to see a surgeon
Or whatever to price it yellow underclothes
So, any road, we went to see the dentist instead
Who gave her a pair of teeth which wasn't any good at all
So instead I'd marry, join the bloody navy and went to sea
Block that kick, block that kick!
In my broken chair, my wings are broken and so is my hair
I'm not in the mood for whirling
Um da
Aaah
How?
Dogs for dogging, hands for clapping
Birds for birding and fish for fishing
Them for themming and when for whimming
Only to find the night-watchman
Unaware of his presence in the building
Onion soup

You never give me your money
You only give me your funny paper
And in the middle of negotiations
You break down
I never give you my number
I only give you my situation
And in the middle of investigation

Out of college, money spent
See no future, pay no rent
All the money's gone, nowhere to go
Any jobber got the sack
Monday morning, turning back
Yellow lorry slow, nowhere to go
But oh, that magic feeling, nowhere to go
Oh, that magic feeling, nowhere to go
Nowhere to go

Soon we'll be away from here
Step on the gas and wipe that tear away

Turn off your mind, relax and float downstream
It is not dying, it is not dying
Lay down all thoughts, surrender to the void
It is shining, it is shining
That you may see the meaning of within
It is being, it is being

It is knowing, it is knowing
That ignorance and hate may mourn the dead
It is believing, it is believing

Wednesday morning at five o'clock as the day begins
Silently closing her bedroom door
Leaving the note that she hoped would say more
She goes downstairs to the kitchen clutching her handkerchief
Quietly turning the backdoor key
Stepping outside, she is free

Is leaving (Sacrificed most of our lives)
Home (We gave her everything money could buy)
She's leaving home after living alone (Bye-bye)
For so many years
Father snores as his wife gets into her dressing gown
Picks up the letter that's lying there

How could she do this to me?"

For the benefit of Mr. Kite
There will be a show tonight on trampoline
The Hendersons will all be there
Late of Pablo Fanque's Fair, what a scene
Over men and horses hoops and garters
Lastly through a hogshead of real fire!
In his way Mr. K. will challenge the world!
The celebrated Mr. K
Performs his feat on Saturday at Bishopsgate
The Hendersons will dance and sing
As Mr. Kite flies through the ring don't be late
Messrs. K. and H. assure the public
Their production will be second to none
And of course Henry The Horse dances the waltz!
The band begins at ten to six
When Mr. K. performs his tricks without a sound
And Mr. H. will demonstrate
Ten somersets he'll undertake on solid ground
Having been some days in preparation
A splendid time is guaranteed for all
And tonight Mr. Kite is topping the bill
I'm so tired, I haven't slept a wink

You know it's three weeks, I'm going insane
You know I'd give you everything I've got

We were talking—about the space between us all
And the people—who hide themselves behind a wall of illusion
Never glimpse the truth—then it's far too late—when they pass away
We were talking—about the love we all could share—when we find it
To try our best to hold it there—with our love
With our love—we could save the world—if they only knew
Try to realise it's all within yourself, no one else can make you change
And to see you're really only very small, and life flows on within you and without you
We were talking—about the love that's gone so cold and the people
Who gain the world and lose their soul
They don't know—they can't see, are you one of them?
When you've seen beyond yourself
Then you may find, peace of mind is waiting there
And the time will come when you see we're all one, and life flows on within you and without you

To say about the things that you do
You're telling all those lies
About the good things that we can have
If we close our eyes
Do what you want to do
And go where you're going to
Think for yourself
'Cause I won't be there with you
I left you far behind
The ruins of the life that you have in mind
And though you still can't see
I know your mind's made up
You're gonna cause more misery

Listen for your footsteps, but they don't arrive

I don't hear it--does it mean you don't love me any more?
I hear the clock a'ticking on the mantel shelf
See the hands a'moving, but I'm by myself
I wonder where you are tonight, and why I'm by myself
I don't see you, does it mean you don't love me any more?
Don't pass me by, don't make me cry, don't make me blue
'Cause you know, darling, I love only you
You'll never know it hurt me so, how I hate to see you go
Don't pass me by
Don't make me cry
I'm sorry that I doubted you, I was so unfair
You were in a car crash, and you lost your hair

They said it wasn't you, but I saw you peep through your window

Love you more than any other guy

I want a love that's right
But right is only half of what's wrong
I want a short haired girl
Who sometimes wears it twice as long
Now I'm stepping out this old brown shoe
Baby, I'm in love with you
I'm so glad you came here
It won't be the same now, I'm telling you
You know you pick me up
From where some try to drag me down
And when I see your smile
Replacing every thoughtless frown
Got me escaping from this zoo
Baby, I'm in love with you
I'm so glad you came here
It won't be the same now when I'm with you
If I grow up I'll be a singer
Wearing rings on every finger
Not worrying what they or you say
I'll live and love and maybe someday
Who knows, baby, you may comfort me, hey
You might also like
I may appear to be imperfect
My love is something you can't reject
I'm changing faster than the weather
If you and me should get together
Who knows, baby, you may comfort me
I want that love of yours
To miss that love is something I'd hate
I'll make an early start
I'm making sure that I'm not late, hey
For your sweet top lip, I'm in the queue
Baby, I'm in love with you
I'm so glad you came here
It won't be the same now when I'm with you
I'm so glad you came here
It won't be the same now when I'm with you
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Doo dah, doo doo doo

A taste of honey!
Tasting much sweeter than wine
I dream of your first kiss, and then
I feel upon my lips again
A taste of honey (A taste of honey)
Tasting much sweeter than wine
Oh, I will return, yes, I will return
I'll come back for the honey and you
Yours was the kiss that awoke my heart
There lingers still, though we're far apart
That taste of honey (A taste of honey)
Tasting much sweeter than wine
Oh, I will return, yes, I will return

Uh, oh

I sit alone at home and I cry over you
What can I do?
Can't help myself
'Cause, baby, it's you (Sha-la-la-la-la-la-la)

You are tearin' me apart
When you treat me so unkind

Just let me hear some of that rock and roll music
Any old way you choose it
It's got a back beat, you can't lose it
Any old time you use it
It's got to be rock and roll music
If you want to dance with me
If you want to dance with me
I've got no kick against modern jazz
Unless they try to play it too darn fast
And lose the beauty of the melody
Until they sound just like a symphony
That's why I go for that that rock and roll music
Any old way you choose it
It's got a back beat, you can't lose it
Any old time you use it
It's got to be rock and roll music

Way down South they had a jubilee
Them Georgia folks they had a jamboree
They're drinking home brew from a wooden cup
The folks dancing there are all shook up
And started playing that rock and roll music
Any old time you use it
It's got a back beat, you can't lose it
Any old time you use it
Got to be rock and roll music
If you want to dance with me
If you want to dance with me
Don't care to hear them play a tango
And in the mood they take a mambo
It's way to early for a congo
So keep a rocking that piano
That's why I go for that rock and roll music
Any old time you use it
It's got a back beat, you can't lose it
Any old time you use it
Oh, you got rock 'n roll music

It's been a long time, now I'm coming back home
I've been away now, oh, how I've been alone
Wait till I come back to your side

But if your heart breaks, don't wait, turn me away
And if your heart's strong, hold on, I won't delay

We'll make a film about a man that's sad and lonely

Might win an Oscar, you can never tell

The biggest fool that ever hit the big time

If I catch you talking to that boy again
I’m going to let you down
And leave you flat
Because I told you before
Oh, you can’t do that

I look at you all, see the love there that's sleeping
While my guitar gently weeps
I look at the floor and I see it needs sweeping
Still my guitar gently weeps
I don't know why nobody told you
How to unfold your love
I don't know how someone controlled you
They bought and sold you
I look at the world and I notice it's turning
While my guitar gently weeps
With every mistake we must surely be learning
Still my guitar gently weeps
I don't know how you were diverted
You were perverted too
I don't know how
You were inverted
No one alerted you
I look from the wings at the play you are staging
While my guitar gently weeps
As I’m sitting here, doing nothing but aging
I been told when a boy kiss a girl
Take a trip around the world
Hey, hey (Bop shuop, m'bop bop shuop)

Is a little dark and out of key

NARRATOR:
Once upon a time, or maybe twice, there was an unearthly paradise called Pepperland. Eighty thousand leagues beneath the sea it lay... or lie, I'm not too sure.
CHIEF BLUE MEANIE:
Pepperland is a tickle of joy on the blue belly of the universe. It must be scratched.
Right, Max?
MAX:
Yes, Your Blueness.
CHIEF BLUE MEANIE:
What?! We Meanies only take NO for an answer. Is that understood, Max?
MAX:
No, Your Blueness.
CHIEF BLUE MEANIE:
That's better. Are the troops in readiness?
MAX:
No, Your Blueness.
CHIEF BLUE MEANIE:
The Bonkers?
MAX:
No.
CHIEF BLUE MEANIE:
Clowns?
MAX:
No.
CHIEF BLUE MEANIE:
Snapping Turks?
MAX:
No.
CHIEF BLUE MEANIE:
Anti-music missiles?
MAX:
No.
CHIEF BLUE MEANIE:
The dreadful Flying Glove?
MAX:
No.
CHIEF BLUE MEANIE:
Splendid! Today, Pepperland goes blooey! Fire!
FRED:
The Meanies are coming! The Meanies are coming!
CHIEF BLUE MEANIE:
Glove, Glove, come here, Glove! Look out there, and what do you see? Tell him, Max.
MAX:
Someone running, Glove.
CHIEF BLUE MEANIE:
Yes. Well, you'll soon put a stop to that, won't you, Glovey? Go, Glove, point! And having pointed, pounce down! I haven't laughed so much since Pompeii! What?! What?! What?! The Glove is losing his touch. Do your worst! Explode them!
FRED :
It's not polite to point!
CHIEF BLUE MEANIE:
Thing of beauty... Destroy it for ever!
FRED :
Sir, Sir, the Meanies are coming!
MAYOR:
Not here, young Fred. They wouldn't dare.
FRED:
They would. They are. What are you going to do?
MAYOR:
Finish the quartet.
BLUE MEANIES:
Fire!
FRED:
Trio, sir.
FRED:
Duet, sir.
MAYOR
Duet?
FRED:
Solo!
MAYOR:
Young Fred, the Blue Meanies are coming!
MAYOR:
4 scores and 32 bars ago our forefathers...
FRED:
Our quartet?
MAYOR:
And foremothers...
FRED:
Another quartet?
MAYOR:
Made it in this yellow submarine...
FRED:
What, that little thing?
MAYOR:
To Pepperland. Climb aboard, young Fred.
FRED:
But, sir, I can't even make my soap float.
MAYOR:
I'm appointing you Lord Admiral.
FRED:
Lord Admiral? In that event, yes.
MAYOR:
Hurry, Young Fred. Go! Get help!
FRED:
Where should I go?
MAYOR:
No time for trivialities.
CREDITS
In the town where I was born
Lived a man who sailed to sea
And he told us of his life
In the land of submarines
So we sailed on to the sun
Till we found the sea of green
And we lived beneath the waves
In our Yellow Submarine
We all live in a Yellow Submarine
Yellow Submarine, Yellow Submarine
We all live in a Yellow Submarine
Yellow Submarine, Yellow Submarine
And our friends are all aboard
Many more of them live next door
And the band begins to play
We all live in a Yellow Submarine
Yellow Submarine, Yellow Submarine
…
Full speed ahead, Mr. Boatswain.
Full speed ahead.
Full speed it is, sir.
Action stations! Action stations!
Aye, sir, aye.
Captain, Captain!
As we live a life of ease
Every one of us has all we need
Sky of blue and sea of green
In our Yellow Submarine
We all live in a Yellow Submarine,
Yellow Submarine, Yellow Submarine,
…
Ah, look at all the lonely people
Ah, look at all the lonely people
Eleanor Rigby
Picks up the rice in the church where a wedding has been
Lives in a dream
Waits at the window
Wearing the face that she keeps in a jar by the door
Who is it for?
All the lonely people
Where do they all come from?
All the lonely people,
where do they all belong?
Father McKenzie
Writing the words of a sermon that no-one will hear
No-one comes near
Look at him working
Darning his socks in the night when there's nobody there
What does he care?
All the lonely people,
where do they all come from?
All the lonely people,
where do they all belong?
Ah, look at all the lonely people
Ah, look at all the lonely people
Eleanor Rigby
Died in the church and was buried along with her name
Nobody came
Father McKenzie
Wiping the dirt from his hands as he walks from the grave
No-one was saved
All the lonely people,
where do they all come from?
All the lonely people,
where do they all belong?
RINGO:
Who... is me? Liverpool can be a lonely place on a Saturday night. And this is only Thursday morning. Compared with my life, Eleanor Rigby's was a gay, mad whirl. Nothing ever happens to me. I feel like an old, splintered drumstick. I'd jump into the River Mersey, but it looks like rain. Nothing ever happens to me.
BOBBY:
Puss, puss-puss. Puss, puss, puss. Here, pussy. Here, pussy, pussy, pussy. Here, pussy, pussy.  Ahem, er...
RINGO:
Would you believe me if I told you I was being followed by a yellow submarine?
BOBBY:
No, I would not.
RINGO:
Oh yeah, I didn't think you would.
RINGO:
I could have sworn there was a yellow submarine. But that isn't logical, is it? It must have been one of them unidentified flying cupcakes or a figment of my imagination.
But I don't have an imagination.
FRED:
Help, help, help!
RINGO :
Thanks, I don't need any.
FRED:
Help! Won't you please, please help me?
RINGO:
Be specific.
FRED:
... music ... submarine ... Blue Meanies!!!
RINGO:
What you need is...
FRED:
'H' for hurry, 'E' for ergent, 'L' for love me and 'P' for p-p-p-p-please help.
VOZ:
Hiya, baby!
RINGO:
Your story has touched my heart. Jump in, we'll get my friends.
FRED:
Bless you!
RINGO:
Did I sneeze?
FRED:
Just park it here.
RINGO:
I'll just park it here.
FRED:
What would your friends be doing here?
RINGO:
Displaying.
FRED:
Displaying what?
RINGO:
Displaying around.
FRED:
Can't we take one of these?
RINGO:
No, Fred, I only work with me mates.
FRED:
Frankenstein?
RINGO:
I used to go out with his sister.
FRED:
His sister?
RINGO:
Yeah. Phyllis. Hey, I wonder what would happen if I pulled this lever.
FRED:
You mustn't do that.
RINGO:
Can't help it. I'm a born lever-puller.
JOHN:
Ringo, I've just had the strangest dream.
RINGO:
I warned you not to eat on an empty stomach. Now listen to old Fred.
FRED:
... music ... submarine ... Blue Meanies!!!
RINGO:
What do you think?
JOHN:
I think he needs a rehearsal.
JOHN:
When do we leave?
RINGO:
Let's get the other two, John.
JOHN:
What day is it?
RINGO:
Sitar-day.
JOHN:
Then George will be here.
RINGO:
George, what are you doing up there?
GEORGE :
Now, what is it, Ringo? Is there a matter you'd like to take up or down?
RINGO :
This chap here...
FRED :
...Blue Meanies!!!
GEORGE:
You're nuts, the pair of you.
RINGO:
Wait a minute, that's my car.
GEORGE:
How do you know it's your car?
RINGO:
I'd know it anywhere.
GEORGE:
What's it look like, then?
RINGO:
It's red with yellow wheels. I mean, blue with orange wheels.
GEORGE:
It's all in the mind.
RINGO:
Come on, move over, I'm driving.
GEORGE:
I got here first.
RINGO/GEORGE:
I'll drive, if you like... No, you sit in the middle... I'm sitting in the middle... You said you were driving... I am driving... I'll get in the back, then.
JOHN:
Do you think we're interrupting something?
RINGO:
I think so. We'd better find Paul, hadn't we?
GEORGE:
It's all in the mind.
JOHN:
Try one of those doors.
GEORGE:
Yes, they do look very nice, don't they?
RINGO:
Yes, they do.
JOHN:
They do, though, don't they?
GEORGE:
Yes, they do.
RINGO:
Don't dey, dough?
GEORGE:
Dough?
JOHN:
Don't ask. Dat's dough.
PAUL:
What's the matter, folks?
RINGO:
Blue Meanies.
FRED:
Well, lads, what do you think?
JOHN :
I think that...
FRED:
Remember, there'll be rough seas ahead. So, what do you think?
PAUL:
Well, then, um...
FRED:
Pounding, overwhelming waves. What do you think of that?
JOHN:
Well, I think that...
RINGO:
As a matter of fact, I...
ALL BEATLES:
I think...
FRED:
Well?
RINGO:
I've forgotten.
FRED:
Right, then, let's get this vessel shipshape.
JOHN:
I kind of like the way it is, submarine shape.
We see a series of landscapes. We hear the end of “A day in the life”.
PAUL:
So, this is a submarine.
JOHN:
Soft, isn't it?
RINGO:
Not if you're on the bottom.
FRED:
All right, lads, time to stow the gab and turn to.
PAUL:
Groovy. How do you start this thing?
FRED:
It starts with a Blue Meanie attack.
JOHN:
Supposing there's no Blue Meanies in the neighbourhood?
FRED:
Then you start looking for a switch.
RINGO:
Perhaps this is it.
One, two, three, four / Can I have a little more?
Five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten / I love you
A, B, C, D / Can I bring my friend to tea?
E, F, G, H, I, J / I love you
Sail the ship
Chop the tree
Skip the rope
Look at me
All together now
All together now (all together now)…
Black, white, green, red / Can I take my friend to bed?
Pink, brown, yellow, orange and blue / I love you (All together now)
All together now (all together now),
all together now (all together now)...
Sail the ship
Chop the tree
Skip the rope
Look at me
All together now
All together now (all together now)…
RINGO:
What time is it?
JOHN:
It's time to time.
PAUL:
Look, the hands are slowing down.
PAUL:
Do you ever get the feeling...
JOHN:
Yeah.
PAUL:
… that things aren't as rosy as they appear to be under the surface?
RINGO:
What's happening, John?
JOHN:
Well, in my humble opinion, we've become involved in Einstein's time-space continuum theory.
GEORGE:
All right.
JOHN:
Relatively speaking, that is.
GEORGE:
Of course. Maybe time's gone on strike.
RINGO:
What for?
GEORGE:
Shorter hours.
RINGO:
I don't blame it. It must be very tiring being time, mustn't it?
JOHN & PAUL:
Why?
RINGO:
It's a twenty-four hour day, isn't it?
JOHN:
You surprise me, Ringo.
RINGO:
Why?
JOHN:
Dealing in abstracts.
RINGO:
Just because I'm a drummer... I don't half feel funny.
PAUL :
You're not half the lad you used to be.
GEORGE 
Look, everything's getting bigger.
JOHN :
It's not. It's us that are getting smaller...
RINGO :
I want my mam.
FRED:
And younger. There you are, lads. Old Fred will get you out of all this.
RINGO 
Look at that!
GEORGE:
It's all a load of Father Xmas's.
JOHN:
It's not. It's Father Time.
GEORGE:
How do you know?
JOHN:
I read it in a book.
FRED:
I don't want to alarm you, but the years are going backwards.
GEORGE:
What's that mean, old Fred?
FRED:
It means if we slip back through time at this rate, very soon we'll all disappear up our own existence.
JOHN:
What are we gonna do, then?
FRED:
We could always try a few buttons.
RINGO :
I want my mam.
FRED:
Time's fast running out for us, I'm afraid!
JOHN:
Can't we do something to the clock?
GEORGE:
What do you mean, John?
JOHN:
Move the hands forward, see what happens.
FRED:
Clever lad.
JOHN:
Something strange is happening. It's speeding up now.
PAUL :
Funny... a submarine remarkably like our own.
JOHN:
Uncannily.
RINGO:
There's someone in it. Look.
JOHN:
And they're waving.
RINGO:
It's a group of fellas.
JOHN:
Wave back. Maybe we're both part of a vast yellow submarine fleet.
RINGO:
There's only two of us.
JOHN:
Then I would suggest that yonder yellow submarine is one of ourselves…
FRED:
Going backwards...
JOHN:
… in time!
GEORGE:
Look at Ringo.
JOHN:
Oh dear, we're all the same.
PAUL:
Senile delinquents.
GEORGE:
And I can hear my beard growing.
RINGO:
We'd better do something.
When I get older, losing my hair
Many years from now
Will you still be sending me a valentine
Birthday greetings, bottle of wine
If I'd been out till quarter to three
Would you lock the door?
Will you still need me,
will you still feed me
When I'm sixty-four?
You'll be older, too
And if you say the word
I could stay with you
I could be handy mending a fuse
When your lights have gone
You can knit a sweater by the fireside
Sunday mornings, go for a ride
[A text can be read: “sixty-four years is 33.661.440 minutes and one minute is a
long time… Let us demonstrate”.]
Doing the garden, digging the weeds
Who could ask for more?
Will you still need me,
will you still feed me
When I'm sixty-four?
Every summer we can rent a cottage
in the Isle of Wight, if it's not too dear
We shall scrimp and save
Grandchildren on your knee,
Vera, Chuck and Dave
Send me a postcard, drop me a line
Stating point of view
Indicate precisely
what you mean to say
Yours sincerely, wasting away
Give me your answer, fill in a form,
mine forever more
Will you still need me,
will you still feed me
When I'm sixty-four?
JOHN:
Well, correct me if I'm wrong, gentlemen, but would you agree that we have been passing through the Sea of Time?
RINGO:
That would explain a few things. I'm glad I'm not young any more. Or was it old?
JOHN:
What kind of a sea is this?
FRED:
The Sea of Science.
JOHN:
Oh, yeah.
If you're listening to this song
You may think the chords are going wrong
But they're not
He just wrote it like that
When you're listening late at night
You may think the band are not quite right
But they are
They just play it like that
It doesn't really matter
What chords I play
What words I say
Or time of day it is
Cause it's only a Northern Song
It doesn't really matter
What clothes I wear
Or how I fare or if my hair is brown
When it's only a Northern Song
If you think the harmony
Is a little dark and out of key
You're correct
There's nobody there
And I told you there's no-one there.
GEORGE:
He looks wrong.
PAUL:
He doesn't look at all well.
GEORGE:
In fact, he's horrible.
JOHN :
He's so ugly.
ALL:
Really ugly!
FRED:
Somebody push a button.
JOHN:
There's a cyclops.
PAUL:
Can't be. He's got two eyes.
JOHN:
Then it must be a bi-cyclops.
GEORGE:
There's another one.
JOHN:
A whole cyclopedia.
JOHN:
There's a school of whales.
RINGO:
They look a bit old for school.
PAUL:
University, then.
RINGO :
University of Whales. They look like dropouts to me.
FRED:
You've got to steer clear!
RINGO:
Steer clear?
FRED:
Yes, steer. Clear?
RINGO:
Yes, dear.
FRED:
Now, whatever you do, don't touch that button.
RINGO:
Which button?
FRED:
That one.
RINGO:
This one?
FRED:
That was the panic button.
PAUL:
Poor Ringo.
JOHN:
Poor lad.
GEORGE:
Never did no harm to no-one.
JOHN:
Lads, now Ringo's gone, what are we gonna do?
FRED:
Learn to sing trios.
PAUL:
No, let's save the poor devil.
JOHN:
I see footsteps.
FRED:
It's a pair of kinky boot-beasts.
JOHN:
Preparing to attack.
JOHN:
I don't half miss Ringo.
PAUL:
He's far out there.
JOHN:
Always was.
RINGO:
'H' is for hurry!
PAUL:
Here comes Ringo!
JOHN:
There goes Ringo.
GEORGE:
It's seen us.
FRED:
Find a boxing button.
PAUL:
Whoever heard of a boxing button?
JOHN:
Who cares? Find one.
FRED :
Fire one!
FRED:
Uh-oh, wrong one.
JOHN:
That.
GEORGE:
There goes Ringo again.
JOHN:
Rides well, doesn't he?
RINGO:
'E' is for ergent...
FRED:
Oh no, not the dreaded vacuum again.
PAUL:
We'll be sucked into oblivion.
GEORGE:
Or even further.
FRED:
Put her in reverse.
JOHN:
So long, sucker.
PAUL:
Too much.
GEORGE:
Too soon.
FRED:
Reverse! Reverse!
JOHN:
Ringo time.
RINGO:
'L' is for love me...
JOHN:
Indians!
RINGO:
Help! Help! 'P' is for please...
JOHN:
So, press a button.
JOHN:
How was it, Ringo?
RINGO :
'Arrowing.
FRED:
Look who's back. Full speed ahead.
RINGO:
Oh, no.
JOHN:
The motor's packing in.
FRED:
By all the sea nymphs, we're losing power. We're being swallowed. What shall we do?
PAUL:
Serve tea.
JOHN:
Lovely.
FRED:
By Neptune's knickerbockers, she's puttered out.
JOHN:
Maybe we should call a road service.
PAUL:
Can't. No road.
RINGO:
And we're not sub-scribers.
JOHN, PAUL, GEORGE:
Subscribers! Oh!
GEORGE:
I know something about motors. Let me have a look.
FRED:
Here.
GEORGE:
Is that the motor?
FRED:
Can't you tell one when you see one?
GEORGE:
Of course I can. Let me peruse it.
JOHN:
What do you think?
GEORGE:
I think I burned my finger.
RINGO :
Here, lads. Look at this.
JOHN:
What do you think it is?
GEORGE:
Nothing.
RINGO:
Looks like nothing.
PAUL:
It's a local inhabitant.
RINGO:
He's probably one of the nothings.
PAUL:
At least that's something. Let's show him our motor.
JOHN:
Steady on. You don't want to show your motor to just anybody.
GEORGE:
But this is a nobody.
JEREMY:
Medic, pedic, zed oblique,
orphic, morphic, dorphic, Greek.
Ad hoc, ad loc and quid pro quo.
So little time, so much to know.
JOHN:
Can you tell us where we're at?
JEREMY:
A true Socratic query, that.
JOHN:
And who the Billy Shears are you?
JEREMY:
Who? Who indeed am I?
JOHN :
Jeremy?
PAUL :
Hillary?
GEORGE :
Boob?
RINGO :
Ph. D?
ALL:
Who?
JEREMY:
Eminent physicist, polyglot classicist,
prize-winning botanist,
hard biting satirist,
talented pianist, good dentist, too.
JOHN:
Lousy poet.
JEREMY:
Critic's voice, take your choice.
RINGO:
Must be one of them angry young men.
PAUL:
Or a daffy old creep.
JEREMY:
I, daffy old creep?
GEORGE:
Do you speak English?
JEREMY:
Old English, middle, a dialect, pure...
PAUL:
Well, do you speak English?
JEREMY:
You know, I'm not sure.
RINGO:
He's so smart, he doesn't even remember what he knows.
PAUL:
Why don't we show him our motor?
JOHN:
Should we really... show him our motor?
PAUL:
He may not have seen one before.
JEREMY:
Turbo-prop, super-combustible spring.
Metrocyclonic and stereophonic,
This motor, I see, has a broken down thing.
JOHN:
He fixed it?
PAUL:
He fixed it.
GEORGE:
Great. Let's go.
JEREMY:
I must complete my bust, two novels,
finish my blueprints, begin my beguine.
JOHN:
Must you always talk in rhyme?
JEREMY:
If I spoke prose, you'd all find out,
I don't know what I talk about.
Ad hoc, ad loc and quid pro quo.
So little time, so much to know.
PAUL:
Hey, fellas. Look.
JEREMY:
The footnotes for my 19th book.
This is my standard procedure for doing it.
And while I compose it,
I'm also reviewing it.
GEORGE:
A boob for all seasons.
PAUL:
How can he lose?
JOHN:
Were your notices good?
JEREMY:
It's my policy never to read my reviews.
JOHN:
There must be a word for what he is.
He's a real Nowhere Man
Sitting in his Nowhere Land
Making all his Nowhere plans for nobody
Doesn't have a point of view,
Knows not where he's going to
Isn't he a bit like you and me
Nowhere Man, please listen,
You don't know what you're missing
Nowhere Man, the world is at your command
He's as blind as he can be,
Just sees what he wants to see
Nowhere Man, can you see me at all?
Nowhere Man, don't worry,
Take your time, don't hurry
Leave it all till somebody else
lends you a hand
Doesn't have a point of view,
Knows not where he's going to
Isn't he a bit like you and me
Nowhere Man, please listen,
You don't know what you're missing
Nowhere Man, the world is at your command
He's a real Nowhere Man,
Sitting in his nowhere land
Making all his Nowhere plans for nobody
Making all his Nowhere plans for nobody
Making all his Nowhere plans for nobody
JOHN:
Okay, men, all aboard. Let's go somewhere.
RINGO:
What about him?
JOHN:
He's happy enough going around in circles.
RINGO:
Poor little fella.
PAUL:
I don't know. Ringo's just a sentimentalist.
RINGO:
Look at him. Can't he come with us? 
Mr. Boob, you can come with us, if you like.
JEREMY:
You mean, you'd take a Nowhere Man?
RINGO:
Come on, we'll take you somewhere.
JOHN 
Okay, Booby. Down the hatch.
JEREMY :
Down the hatch. A quite curious phrase.
The middle South Midlands
Victorian phase.
It's usage undoubtedly on the increase.
I must work it into
my New Statesman piece.
JOHN:
That's the hatch, friend.
JEREMY:
Indeed.
FRED:
Steady now, crew. Prepare to go forward.
GEORGE:
Forward.
PAUL:
Forward.
JOHN:
Forward.
RINGO:
Forward.
ALL:
Forward!
JOHN:
It's awfully quiet.
GEORGE:
What shall we do, Jeremy?
JEREMY:
Repair, revive, revamp, renew.
Ipse dixit, just turn the screw.
JEREMY:
Log sign, clog sign, big thingamabob.
JOHN:
What's he saying?
PAUL:
What's he doing?
JEREMY:
Chewing gum will do the job. A turn of the screw, and all is and all is new.
FRED:
I can't stop her. 'H' is for hurry, 'E' is for ergent, 'L' is for love me…
JOHN:
'P' is for... goodbye?
GEORGE:
That was lovely, Jeremy.
PAUL:
We've lost the sub for good.
JOHN:
Or for bad. Or for worse.
JEREMY:
I'm sorry about that.
RINGO:
But he did fix the motor.
PAUL:
Where are we?
JOHN:
It looks like the foothills.
PAUL:
The foothills of what?
JOHN:
The foothills of the headlands.
Picture yourself in a boat on a river
With tangerine trees
and marmalade skies
Somebody calls you,
you answer quite slowly
A girl with kaleidoscope eyes
Cellophane flowers of yellow and green
Towering over your head
Look for the girl with the sun
in her eyes and she's gone
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Follow her down to a bridge by a fountain
Where rocking horse people
eat marshmallow pies
Everyone smiles
as you drift past the flowers
That grow so incredibly high
Newspaper taxis appear on the shore
Waiting to take you away
Climb in the back with your head
in the clouds and you're gone
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Picture yourself on a train in a station
With Plasticine porters
with looking glass ties
Suddenly someone is there at the turnstile
The girl with kaleidoscope eyes
Lucy in the sky with diamonds…
JOHN:
Carry on, lads, carry on.
RINGO:
Certainly was carrying on.
JOHN:
I feel a draft.
PAUL:
We must be near the Sea of Holes. Don't you think we should ask somebody for directions?
JOHN 
Excuse us...
PAUL:
Can you tell us the way to Pepperland?
JOHN:
Thanks.
PAUL:
Gosh, look at all this dust? Where did it come from?
JEREMY:
A chemical error and quite imprecise. This is a condiment...
RINGO:
Condi...
JEREMY:
A spice.
JOHN:
He's right, you know. It's pepper.
PAUL:
Pepper?
GEORGE:
Pepper.
RINGO:
John? Paul? George? Is anybody home?
PAUL:
Where are we?
JOHN:
A holey sea. This place reminds me of Blackburn, Lancashire.
PAUL:
Oh, boy...
GEORGE:
How many do you think there are in all?
JEREMY:
Enough to fill the Albert Hall.
PAUL:
Didn't old Fred mention something about the Sea of Holes just before the Sea of Green?
JOHN:
Yeah.
GEORGE:
Through one of them spots must be the Sea of Green. But which? Which one?
JEREMY:
Thesis, antithesis, synthesis, causes of causal causation.
JOHN:
Jeremy, what do you know about holes?
JEREMY:
There are simply no holes in my education.
PAUL:
You mean you haven't composed a whole book?
GEORGE:
Great. What shall we do?
JEREMY:
Be empirical. Look.
RINGO:
The booby's making more and more sense.
PAUL:
It's getting better all the time.
JOHN:
Great. Come on, let's all look for the Sea of Green. The Sea of Holes... into the Sea of Green.
JEREMY:
Hydrolate, verdant chrysodine.
I think we're near the Sea of Green.
RINGO:
I've got a hole in me pocket.
PAUL:
Where's Jeremy?
JOHN:
He was over there.
GEORGE:
He's not here now.
PAUL:
He must have jumped ship, then.
RINGO:
He wouldn't do that. He's our friend. Booby, Jeremy, Hillary, where are you?
JOHN:
Pepperland. A bit salty around the edges. Looks all dingy.
GEORGE:
And drab.
PAUL:
And quiet.
JOHN:
Safe at last.
PAUL:
And none the worse for our adventures.
JOHN:
Reminiscent in many ways of the late Mr. Ulysses.
RINGO:
There's an eye in the apples.
FRED:
There she blows! Lord Mayor, sir... I've made it, I'm back.
GEORGE:
Who's this?
FRED:
Our Lord Mayor. He's been bonked. . Lord Mayor, sir... unbonk yourself. Even a little snatch of a tune might get him up again.
JOHN:
All right, let's sing.
Have you got time to rectify, time to rectify...
MAYOR:
Do I hear music? Do I see... young Fred?
FRED:
You do, Lord Mayor.
MAYOR:
Bless my metronome. And did you bring the help?
FRED:
Yes, yes. Look.
MAYOR:
Holy pizzicato, young Fred. It's quite uncanny, your faces...
PAUL:
We're quite cute, really.
MAYOR:
You could pass for the originals.
JOHN:
We are the originals.
MAYOR:
No, no... Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band.
RINGO:
They couldn't be much with a name like that. Sergeant Pepper?
FRED
You could impersonate them and rally the land to rebellion.
MAYOR
Where are your instruments?
JOHN
Lost in the Monstrous Sea.
PAUL
Sea of Monsters.
FRED
We'll get other instruments, Lord Mayor.
MAYOR
Not a chance. The Meanies captured everything that maketh music.
PAUL
They hate music that much, do they?
MAYOR
They shrink at the very sound.
JOHN
Okay, you guys. It's shrinking time in Pepperland.
All people in Pepperland keeps grey and motionless (except for escape from the blue
meanies).
BLUE MEANIE
Aim, fire!
The Beatles hide behind cut-outs.
PAUL
He reminds me of my old English teacher.
JOHN
Look, if you must shout, shout quietly.
GEORGE
What do we do?
JOHN
Coagulate with the crowd.
PAUL
Cut-outs at the ready.
JOHN
Then let's cut out.
They come to a high bandstand surrounded by thorns.
PAUL
What a grand bandstand.
JOHN
That's where the gear's kept. Come on.
Blue meanies with dogs.
GEORGE
Cavey, cavey.
At dusk.
PAUL
All right, the coast is clear.
GEORGE
Now's our chance.
RINGO
But how'll we get over?
GEORGE
Easy. Follow me.
They jump the fence of thorns
BLUE MEANIE
A-ha! You fools!
The watch fires his machine gun.
The Beatles reach the bandstand moving between asleep blue meanies.
RINGO
It's not very light in here, is it?
GEORGE
Shh! Keep the noise down.
JOHN
Look what I found. It's their uniforms.
PAUL
Nice bit of gear, that.
RINGO
They'll look great on, eh?
PAUL
Dey will, won't dey?
RINGO
Won't dey, dough.
JOHN
How do I look?
PAUL
Groovy, groovy. How about me?
RINGO, looking thru the window
Bad scene, lads. We're surrounded.
GEORGE
Oh, heck.
RINGO
A million billion Meanies.
PAUL
They're coming this way.
ALL
Hide!
Trying to hide they make a lot of noise.
PAUL
Do you think they heard us?
JOHN
I hope not.
GEORGE
What did you say?
SOMEONE
Shhhh!
GEORGE
Good plan.
1:03:22 DAWN, by Grieg.
PAUL
Look. They're all asleep.
RINGO
They look cute when they're asleep. Almost human.
GEORGE
Come on. Let's get out of here.
PAUL
On tiptoe.
They take their instruments and go down the hill.
RINGO
Tiptoe through the Meanies...
THE OTHER
Shh!
Ringo steps on the bagpipe. Some meanies wake.
PAUL
Let's exude.
The Beatles are persecuted. Ringo falls down and jumps on the John arms.
GEORGE
Relax, lads. Not a Meanie in sight.
JOHN
Not even a teeny Meanie.
PAUL
Not even a teeny-weeny Meanie.
RINGO
Great.
PAUL
Oh, look. Breakfast.
RINGO
I'm dying for a bit of brekky.
George takes an apple. Four tall meanies do the same.
JOHN
Look out.
A blue meanie heads the four tall meanies.
CHIEF
Sound off, one, two, three, four...
TALL MEANIES
One, two, three, four...
The Beatles, one above the other, march behind the row of tall meanies.
JOHN
Five.
CHIEF
Five?  Sound off, one, two, three,
four.
TALL MEANIES
One, two, three...
JOHN
Four.
John eliminates another one.
TALL MEANIES
One, two...
JOHN
Three.
CHIEF
Three?
JOHN
Two.
CHIEF
Two?
JOHN
One.
CHIEF
One?  Are you Bluish? You
don't look Bluish.
JOHN
Run for it.
The Beatles escape again.
PAUL
Right, men. We've made it.
GEORGE
Instruments at the ready.
JOHN
Okay, on the beat. A-one, a-two, a-three, a-four, a-five, a-six…
RINGO
Hey, can't you make it three?
JOHN
All right. On the beat of three... A-one, a-two, a-three...
1:06:34 THE BEATLES: SGT. PEPPER’S LONELY HEARTS CLUB BAND
It was twenty years ago today,
Sgt. Pepper taught the band to play
They've been going in and out of style,
But they're guaranteed to raise a smile
So may I introduce to you,
The act you've known for all these years
Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band
We're Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band
We hope you will enjoy the show
Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band
Sit back and let the evening go
Sgt. Pepper's Lonely,
Sgt. Pepper's Lonely
Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band
It's wonderful to be here,
it's certainly a thrill
You're such a lovely audience,
we'd like to take you home with us
We'd love to take you home
I don't really wanna stop the show,
But I thought you might like to know
That the singer's gonna sing a song,
And he wants you all to sing along
So let me introduce to you,
The one and only Billy Shears
Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band
THE BEATLES: WITH A LITTLE HELP FROM MY FRIENDS
Billy Shears!
What would you think if I sang out of tune?
Would you stand up and walk out on me?
Lend me your ears and I'll sing you a song
And I'll try not to sing out of key
The inhabitants of Pepperland recover color and smile. Lennon has been presented as Billy Shears, but Ringo’s voice is heard.
01:08:49 THE MEANIES GATHER AROUND THEIR CHIEF
CHIEF BLUE MEANIE
Ah! The hills are alive...
ASSISTANT
With the sound of music.
The Chief Blue Meanie hits his assistant. Then he gets a tantrum.
CHIEF BLUE MEANIE
Who is responsible for this?
ASSISTANT
Rimsky Korsakov?
The assistant is shot and kicking, but still resurfaces.
ASSISTANT
Guy Lombardo?
CHIEF BLUE MEANIE, laughs
My dear friend... let us not forget that heaven is blue.  Tomorrow, the world! Bring in my Bluebird.
PEPPERLAND INHABITANTS
Who? Who? Who?
PAUL, GEORGE, RINGO
Who? Who? Who?
The mouth of John expels the question WHO?
A blue big glove crosses the air.
CHIEF BLUE MEANIE
Ah! Here you are, my little Glovey-dovey. Go get thee hence and destroy yon upstarts.  Smash them! Squash them! Crash them! Oblue-terate them!
MEDICAL DOCTOR, as the Chief collapses
Here, your Blueness, have some nasty medicine.
CHIEF, exuberant
The Glove, the Glove, the Glove!
PAUL, GEORGE, RINGO
Glove? Glove? Glove?
From the mouth of John emerge the word GLOVE.
GEORGE
He's a clever lad, isn't he?
RINGO
Open your mouth, it won't hurt.  John, you haven't half got a big mouth, haven't you?
GEORGE
It's easy. All you need is love.
JOHN
Yes.
And expeles again the word GLOVE, but this time the initial G vanishes.
1:12:02 THE BEATLES : ALL YOU NEED IS LOVE
Love, love, love (x3)
There's nothing you can do that can't be done
Nothing you can sing that can't be sung
Nothing you can say but you can learn how to play the game
It's easy
All you need is love
All you need is love
All you need is love, love,
Love is all you need
Nothing you can know that isn't known,
Nothing you can see that isn't shown
There's nowhere you can be
that isn't where you're meant to be
It's easy
All you need is love, (All together now)
All you need is love, (Everybody)
All you need is love, love,
Love is all you need
All you need is love
All you need is love
All you need is love, love
The words emerged from the mouth of John neutralize the glove attacks.
JOHN
Go, Glove, lovely Glove.
RINGO
You took the words right out of my mouth, John.
GEORGE
Hey, wait, and watch.  It's all in the mind, you know.
Love is all you need
Love is all you need
Everything revives in Pepperland. The word NO becomes NOW and then KNOW.
She loves you, yeah, yeah, yeah
The meanies flee and The Beatles are acclaimed by the crowd.
A little bit further they find a blue glass ball.
GEORGE
Hey, that's a funny place to leave a goldfish bowl.
JOHN
In Pepperland all things are possible.
PAUL
It's not a goldfish bowl.
RINGO
Just a big glass bowl, then.
PAUL
Yes, blue glass.
RINGO
It must be from Kentucky.
Paul knocks the bowl. Some music starts to sound.
JOHN
There's something inside.
RINGO
Four fellas.
GEORGE
What are they doing there?
PAUL
They're not having a ball, that's for sure.
JOHN
It can't be.
PAUL
It's us.
JOHN
But we're here.
PAUL
It's Sgt. Pepper's...
RINGO
Lonely...
GEORGE
Hearts Club...
GEORGE
Band.
JOHN
The resemblance is truly striking. If I could come in here I think the theory put forward
by Einstein…
PAUL, spoofs an old song called ‘Any old iron’
Any old Ein, any old Ein, any, any, any old Einstein.
JOHN
… could well be applied here. The people in the ball are obviously extensions of our own personalities, suspended, as it were, in time, frozen in space, according to the now famous Theory of Relativity, which, briefly explained, is simply a matter of taking two eggs...
The other three try to break the ball.
PAUL
John!
JOHN
… beating lightly and adding a little salt and pepper...
GEORGE
John!
JOHN
George?
GEORGE
How do we get them out?
JOHN
Break the glass.
GEORGE
We can't. It's Beatle-proof.
JOHN
Nothing is Beatle-proof.
PAUL, to Ringo
Have you got your drumsticks with you? A drum break might shatter it.
RINGO
No, I haven't.
GEORGE
Have a look in your pocket.
1:15:50 “Baby you’re a rich man” is heard.
RINGO
I've got a hole in my pocket. I wonder if...
Ringo sticks the hole on the ball. The ball gets empty.
RINGO
Yeah, it still works.
GEORGE
We take back all we said.
JOHN
You're a genius.
PAUL
A sheer genius.
RINGO
I know, I know, I know.  Like coloured telly.
GEORGE
Like crystal.
PAUL
They're decanting.
The members of the Band face their peers.
RINGO 2
Hello, brother.
RINGO
Yeah, without a doubt.
GEORGE
We're the spitting image of each other.
GEORGE 2
Golly, yeah.
JOHN
I'm led to believe that you're an extension of my personality.
JOHN 2
Yes, I'm your alter-ego man.
JOHN
And I'm the ego man, goo goo, g'joob.  I'm glad you asked me that. Because as a matter of fact there's a war on. Then, brothers in war, to the
skirmish must we hence.
JOHN 2
Shall we hence?
PAUL
Let's not waste time sitting on the hence. Beatles to battle. Charge!
The Blue Meanies attack again. The Beatles run for a hide.
JOHN
We're surrounded.
RINGO, pointing the four-headed dog
Nice dog, though.
The Beatles hide inside a hurdy-gurdy. John turns the crank and sings:
1:17:26 THE BEATLES : HEY BULLDOG
Sheepdog... standing in the rain
Bullfrog... doing it again
Some kind of happiness
is measured out in miles
What makes you think you're
something special when you smile?
Childlike... no one understands
Jack knife... in your sweaty hands
Some kind of innocence
is measured out in years
You don't know what it's like
to listen to your fears
You can talk to me
You can talk to me
You can talk to me
If you're lonely you can talk to me
Big man... walking in the park
Wigwam... frightened of the dark
Some kind of solitude
is measured out in you
You think you know me
but you haven't got a clue
You can talk to me,
You can talk to me
You can talk to me...
if you're lonely you can talk to me
Hey, bulldog (x4)
John to the dog:
What do you say? Sing it.
Do you know any more? Play it!
Todos
Hey, bulldog.
The Beatles escape from the dog and the guards. Ringo finds Jeremy hanging from
the branch of a tree.
RINGO
Jeremy, can it be you?
JEREMY
Can it be me? I think you'd better
inquire of the guards,
for when I was captured,
they took all my cards.
RINGO
Shh, that's enough, Jeremy. Come on, the whole world's being attacked.
JEREMY
What do you want me to do?
Do you recommend fisticuffs
versus the guard?
Oh, guard! Blue Meanio!
Left to the nostril, right uppercut,
right to the eyebrow, left to the gut.
Jeremy stumbles into a tree. An apple falls down and knocks out the meanie. Ringo
congratulates Jeremy.
RINGO
Jeremy!
JEREMY
Come on, Ringo!
The Chief treats to stem the rout.
CHIEF BLUE MEANIE
Get back! Get back! Once more unto the breach, dear Meanies! You're advancing the wrong way! Retreat backwards! Get back there now!
The Chief is swept along.
CHIEF BLUE MEANIE
My kingdom for a horse!  I think I'll tear him up into little pieces.
JEREMY
He does, does he?
CHIEF
I think I'll make a blueburger out of him.
JEREMY
Ha-ha, I don't care what you think.
CHIEF
You don't, eh? We'll soon see about that.
JEREMY
He does in truth seem quite annoyed,
some reference material
before I'm destroyed.
Where ground is soft most often grows,
Arise, arise, arouse, a rose.
A rosy nose?
CHIEF
Speak your last piece!
JEREMY
Peace, peace,
supplant the doom and the gloom.
Turn off what is sour,
turn into a flower and bloom, bloom.
Ha-ha, bloom, ha-ha, bloom,
bloom, bloom...
A lot of pink roses cover the whole body of the Chief. He flees crazy.
RINGO
First time I saw that Nowhere Man, that nobody, I knew he was somebody.
JOHN
You're right. Hello there, blue people. Won't you join us? Buck up, and otherwise go
mingle. What do you say?
CHIEF
Max?
MAX
Your Blue... I mean your Newness!
CHIEF, takes some flowers
It's no longer a blue world, Max. Where could we go?
MAX
Argentina?
JOHN
Are you with us? Will you join?
CHIEF
Shall we?
MAX
No!...  Yes, your Newness!
CHIEF, smiles
Yes, Max...
JEREMY, close to them
Yes. Oh, yes is a word with a glorious ring,
A true, universal, euphonious thing.
In genders embracing
and chasing of blues,
the very best word
for the whole world to use. Ha-ha!
CHIEF
Yes, let us mix, Max. I've never admitted it before, but my cousin is the Bluebird of
Happiness.
1:24:41 THE BEATLES : IT’S ALL TOO MUCH
It's all too much
When I look into your eyes,
Your love is there for me
And the more I go inside,
the more there is to see
It's all too much for me to take
The love that's shining all around here
All the world is birthday cake,
So take a piece but not too much
Everybody dance. Jeremy and the Chief reconcile. The Chief cries of
emotion.
Nice to have the time
to take this opportunity
Time for me to look at you,
and you to look at me
It's all too much for me to see
The love that's shining all around you
Everywhere, it's what you make
For us to take, it's all too much
It's too much
1:26:55 PAUL, RINGO, GEORGE AND JOHN IN PERSON
PAUL
Catchy tune, that.
RINGO
I can't seem to get it out of my head.
GEORGE
Then shake it.
RINGO
That's what we've been doing all night.
PAUL
Yeah, it was a great party.
GEORGE
And we brought back lots of lovely souvenirs. Here is the motor.
PAUL
I've got a little love.
RINGO
And I've got a hole in my pocket.
PAUL
A hole?
RINGO
Half a hole, anyway. I gave the rest to Jeremy.
GEORGE
What can he do with half a hole?
PAUL
Fix it to keep his mind from wandering.
RINGO
Look at John, will you?
John has been looping through a telescope.
PAUL
What's the matter, John? Blue Meanies?
JOHN
Newer and bluer Meanies have been sighted within the vicinity of this theatre.
There's only one way to go out.
GEORGE
How's that?
JOHN
Singing!
RINGO
One...
PAUL
Two...
GEORGE
Three...
JOHN
¡Fire!
1:27:33 THE BEATLES : ALL TOGETHER NOW
One, two, three, four / Can I have a little more?
Five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten / I love you
A, B, C, D / Can I bring my friend to tea?
E, F, G, H, I, J / I love you

A bad little kid moved into my neighborhood
He won't do nothing right, just sitting down and looks so good
He don't want to go to school and learn to read and write
Just sits around the house and plays the rock and roll music all night
Well, he put some tacks on teacher's chair
Puts chewing gum in little girl's hair
Now, junior, behave yourself
Buy every rock and roll book on the magazine stand
Every dime that he gets (oh) is lost to the jukebox man
Well he worries his teacher till at night she's ready to poop
From rocking and a-rolling to spinning in a hula hoop
Well this rock and roll has got to stop
Junior's head is hard as rock
Now, junior, behave yourself
Ooh!
Ooh!
Gonna tell your mama you better do what she said
Get to the barber shop and get that hair cut off your head
Shoot the canary and you fed it to the neighbor's cat
You gave the cocker spaniel a bath in mother's laundromat
Well, in mama's head it's got to stop
